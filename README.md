# Obstacle Avoiding Car


An obstacle-avoiding car is a robotic vehicle equipped with sensors that detect obstacles in its path and automatically adjusts its course to avoid collisions. It typically uses ultrasonic sensors to measure distances, and the controller is programmed to make decisions based on the sensorâ€™s data.

## Overview of Obstacle Avoiding Cars
Obstacle-avoiding cars are compact robotic vehicles equipped with sensors, often ultrasonic, to detect obstacles. Controlled by microcontrollers like Arduino or ESP8266, these cars navigate autonomously, adjusting their course to avoid collisions. They serve as educational tools for learning about robotics and automation, providing hands-on experiences in both manual and automatic modes. 

## Components Required for the Project
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Servo motor
- Motor driver
- ESP8266
- DC motor
